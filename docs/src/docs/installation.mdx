# Installation - WIP

# Using Helm
The probably easiest way to install Shelfdb into your cluster is to use the provided helm script. You need to have Helm 
and Tiller installed first ([How ti install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/))

Once you have Tiller setup in you cluster by running ```helm init``` you can run our helm script

````shell script
helm install --repo https://github.com/Joatin/shelfdb shelfdb
````

# Locally using Docker Compose

Add the following to a local file called ```docker-compose.yaml```

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: "joatin/shelfdb:latest"
    ports:
      - "5600:5600"
```

Now you can start your database by simple running ```docker-compose up```
