## About
Shelf is a database written in rust and that uses GraphQL for it's api and migrations. Graphql makes it easy to 
describe the data resources you want to fetch. Shelf expands that power to simple let ypu describe your data and then 
have the persistence automatically generated for you


## Installation
Shelf is currently under heavy development. Once it reaches alpha it will be deployed through docker hub. As of now you 
can clone this repo and build the source locally through ```cargo run```
